# Photo Blog Landing Page

A simple landing page for a photo blog. This was the first coding project that I ever built by myself before learning JavaScript. I got the inspiration for the photo blog design from Colt Steele while taking his Web Developer Course on Udemy. What I did to improve on his design was add a Bootstrap NavBar with a search box, as well as add a footer at the bottom of the page.
